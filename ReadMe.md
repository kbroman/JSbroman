Bits of JavaScript and CoffeeScript code, as I
learn these languages (with a focus on
interactive graphics)

There are some small examples of (d3)[http://d3js.org] here, but I've
moved the substantive ones to a separate repository: 
(d3examples)[http://github.com/kbroman/d3examples]

There is some really awful code in here.
I just barely know what I'm doing.
