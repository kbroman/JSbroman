### JSbroman

Karl W Broman,

Bits of JavaScript and CoffeeScript code, as I
learn these languages (with a focus on
interactive graphics)

There are some small examples of [d3](http://d3js.org) here, but I've
moved the substantive ones to a separate repository: 
[d3examples](http://github.com/kbroman/d3examples)

There is some really awful code in here.
I just barely know what I'm doing.
