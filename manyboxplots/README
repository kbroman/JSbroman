Top panel is like 500 box plots:
  lines are drawn at the 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 99 percentiles
  for each of 500 distributions
Hover over a column in the top panel and the corresponding distribution
  is show below; click for it to persist; click again to make it go away.

This is awful code; I just barely know what I'm doing.
