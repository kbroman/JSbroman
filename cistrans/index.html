<h3>Interactive cis-trans eQTL plot</h3>

<p id="loading">[Loading...]</p>

<div id="cistrans"></div>

<div id="legend" style="width:700px;margin-left:25px;opacity:0;">
<p>In top-left figure, x-axis corresponds to marker location, y-axis is
genomic position of probes on a gene expression microarray Each
plotted point is an inferred eQTL with LOD > 10; opacity corresponds
to LOD score, though all LOD > 25 are made fully opaque.

<p>Hover over a point to see probe ID and LOD score; also highlighted
are any other eQTL for that probe.  Click on the point to see LOD
curves below.

<p>If a clicked probe is in known gene, title in lower plot is a link
to the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) site at the Jackson Lab.

<p>Hover over markers in LOD curve plot to view marker names; click on
a marker to see the phenotype-vs-genotype plot to right.  In
geno-vs-pheno plot, hover over average to view value, and hover over
points to view individual IDs.

<p>The <a href="cistrans.coffee">code</a> is pretty awful; I just barely know what I'm doing.
